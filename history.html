    <p>
      The meaning of the school emblem is very significant. The meaning of the words
      &quot;Knowledge is power&quot; means that true power comes from knowledge. No individual or
      nation can prosper in life without knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The words &quot; knowledge is power&quot; inspires students to pursue education, as education
      alone has the power to bring to the forefront their hidden potential so as to leave their
      indelible mark in society.
